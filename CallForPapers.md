### CALL FOR PAPERS

The Tools Track is an important part of the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES). The goal of this track is to provide a forum for presentation and demonstration of automated solutions that support the process of developing and managing software systems. It consists of both theoretical presentations and practical exhibitions of the tools, creating a great opportunity for the authors to present and discuss their tools with SBES attendees from the academia and industry. Academics can present results of their applied research projects in the area of Software Engineering, while industry professionals are also welcome to present commercial or in-house tools that have brought gains in productivity and/or quality to the software development processes.

### MANUSCRIPT/VIDEO PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION

We invite authors to submit papers describing automated solutions for diverse aspects and needs related to the topics of interest and themes listed in the CfP of the SBES. 
Each submission consists of a paper accompanied by a demo video about the tool. Submissions must conform to the following submission and formatting instructions:

1. The paper must be original and not submitted or published in other academic vehicles. 

2. The paper should clearly include:
   a) Description of the motivation/problem addressed by the tool; 
   b) Description of the main functionalities and potential users of the tool;
   c) Usage example and screenshots illustrating the tool interface (where applicable); 
   d) Description of the tool architecture, its core components and their interfaces; 
   e) A brief comparison with existing related tools; and
   f) The type of software license.

3. Papers must be no longer than 6 pages, including all figures (in good quality), references and appendices, and formatted according to the ACM 2-column conference (ACM_SigConf) format available at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Papers may be written in Portuguese or English, but papers in Portuguese must also include an abstract in English. Papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).

4. A demo video with audio commentary and with high resolution (details of the tool’s functionality should be clearly visible) MUST accompany the paper submission. 
The demo video (between three to five minutes long) should demonstrate tool usage and highlight its main contributions. It should provide an overview of the tool, its objectives and envisioned users, main features and outputs as well.

There should be an announcer presenting the tool and the speech must be in the same language in which the paper is written. 

5. Authors are encouraged to make the code and datasets of their academic tools open source and provide a URL for them with the submission.

6. The Tools Track will use the single-blind reviewing model, so please include the authors’ identities in the submission materials.

Papers should be submitted electronically through JEMS (https://jems.sbc.org.br/jems2/). Videos should be uploaded to YouTube and made accessible during the time of reviewing. 
The URL at which your demo video can be found should be appended at the end of the paper abstract.

Submissions that do not include a paper AND a demo video, that are not in compliance with the required submission format, that are out of the scope of the track, or that were submitted or published in any other forum (conference or journal), will be rejected without review. 
All other papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. 

During the review process, we may request a rebuttal; in this case, authors will have access to reviews and may argue and answer questions from the referees before the final acceptance/rejection decision. The rebuttal is limited to a plain text up to 4,000 characters.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

The acceptance of the submission implies in at least one author to register for and attend SBES 2020 to present the paper and the tool in person. Both paper presentation and tool demonstration are mandatory for all accepted tools. Paper presentations and tool demonstrations are traditionally held in two different days during SBES.

Tool demonstrations should be live and the demo videos uploaded for submission should NOT be used.  The format and timing of presentations will be announced later.

### BEST TOOL AWARD

Awarded papers of the Tools Track will be announced during the event. The three tools with the best scores from the Program Committee will be awarded.
